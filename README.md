# NewsEye WP5  - Explainer

This is a development repo, you are probably in the wrong place

## Dependencies

### FOMA

The morphological realization for English is dependent on the Foma library. On ubuntu/debian, this should be available
from `apt`.

### Python dependencies

The software is being developed using python 3.6, which is the only officially supported version. At the same time,
we see no reason why the Reporter would fail to run on never versions of Python as well. Let us now if you come
across any problems.

Python library dependencies are defined in requirements.txt, and can be installed by running

```bash
 $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Again, we've only really tested the software using the specific versions listed in the file.

## Testing

The test coverage is far from perfect, but you can run what tests exist with 
```
 $ python -m unittest discover test/
```

## Formatting, linting, etc.

The project is set up for use of `isort`, `black` and `flake8`. 

It's notable that `isort` is only used to *order* the imports (something `black` can't do), but `black`'s *formatting* 
is to be preferred over `isort`. What this means is that **`black` must be ran after `isort`**.

Manually run the formatters and linting with
```
 $ isort -rc . && black . && flake8 .
```

You can run
```
 $ pre-commit install
```
to force git to run both `black` and `flake8` for you before it allows you to commit.
